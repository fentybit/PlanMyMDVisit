## About

<p>The pandemic that has been lingering all around us since early 2020 has caused an apparent challenge to the current healthcare system. It is a testament to the new modern demand of digital healthcare. The conventional healthcare system is currently overflown with predominantly Covid-19 patients, exceeding their abilities to facilitate care of other medical patient needs.</p>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Plan My MD Visit app is to create a virtual patient system where the automation benefits patient 24/7 seeking virtual medical assistance, improving overall patient well-being. My application carries essential features and minimal attributes of tele-health platforms. Patients make their visits to the clinic, laboratory or hospital only when necessary and/or advised by medical professionals.</p>
