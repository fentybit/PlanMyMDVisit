## About

<p>The pandemic that has been lingering all around us since early 2020 has caused an apparent challenge to the current healthcare system. It is a testament to the new modern demand of digital healthcare. The conventional healthcare system is currently overflown with predominantly Covid-19 patients, exceeding their abilities to facilitate care of other medical patient needs.</p>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Plan My MD Visit app is to create a virtual patient system where the automation benefits patient 24/7 seeking virtual medical assistance, improving overall patient well-being. My application carries essential features and minimal attributes of tele-health platforms. Patients make their visits to the clinic, laboratory or hospital only when necessary and/or advised by medical professionals.</p>

## Build Status and Future Improvement
<p>Current project-built was completed in a 2-week timeframe from API data search, model association development, and MVP for both patient and admin user interface. Future cycle of product development as follows:</p>
- [x] Add `Healthcare Provider` to model associations. Patients can find their healthcare providers, and sort through in-network doctors along with their specialties.
- [x] Outsource from different APIs for doctors, currently restricted to Medicare Care Compare eligible professionals.
- [x] Develop more robust user interface for users as doctors.
- [x] Set up customized validations for scheduling appointments where each individual doctor can personalize their schedule availability. 
- [x] Communication features (i.e., messaging) in between doctors and patients.
- [x] Design separate CSS layouts for different user groups: patients, admins and doctors.
